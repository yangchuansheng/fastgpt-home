# Secure Enterprise AI Database Query: Roles, Guardrails, and Validation

Enterprise AI database queries need a boundary between language understanding and database operations. The AI platform can recognize intent, orchestrate a workflow, and format a result. An integration gateway and the enterprise systems should own credentials, permissions, query scope, and data operations. This split gives teams a testable path for every request.

## 1. Define the business scope before connecting data

AI-assisted database queries fit scenarios with a stable data scope, predictable permissions, and reviewable results, such as operational metrics, inventory status, and internal knowledge lookup. Create a scope sheet before implementation. It should name:

- approved databases, tables, fields, and time ranges;
- allowed operations, with read-only access as the default;
- business, technical, and security owners for each data set;
- the purpose, retention period, and human-review rule for each result.

The scope sheet becomes the shared source for gateway rules and acceptance samples. An undefined scope leaves the most important permission decision to the model and increases the risk of unauthorized access.

## 2. Establish an explicit division of labor

| Layer | Responsibilities | Acceptance criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI platform | Recognize intent, collect required parameters, orchestrate workflows, and format results | Sends only controlled intent or parameters, stores no database account, and opens no direct database connection |
| Integration gateway | Store credentials, validate requests, restrict egress, and record audit events | Every database request passes through the gateway; out-of-scope requests are rejected and traceable |
| Enterprise database and business systems | Execute deterministic queries, enforce permissions, and handle approved writes | Only approved operations run, and returned fields and permissions follow business rules |
| Business and security teams | Define scope, review results, handle exceptions, and audit regularly | Owners, review cadence, and escalation paths are documented |

AI output can help a person complete a query, while final authorization remains with the enterprise system. When writes are required, use a separate interface with minimal fields and an additional approval step. Keep write access outside the default query path.

## 3. Configure three security controls

### 3.1 Separate credentials and restrict egress

Keep database accounts, short-lived tokens, and connection settings in an enterprise-controlled gateway or secret manager. The AI platform should receive only the short-lived, least-privilege authorization needed for a request. Database passwords and long-lived keys belong outside platform configuration, logs, and prompts. Network policy should allow the platform to reach only the approved gateway and should record unexpected egress attempts.

### 3.2 Fix query scope at the interface layer

Encode approved tables, fields, filters, page limits, and time ranges in gateway rules. Validate each request structurally and reject unknown fields, dangerous operations, and out-of-range periods. Prompts can explain business rules to the model; interface rules provide the final boundary.

### 3.3 Enforce user permissions and audit every decision

Before execution, the gateway should validate the user identity, role, and data permissions. A rejection should retain a request identifier, user identifier, matched rule, and timestamp for security review. Successful queries should also record the minimum audit fields needed for traceability without copying full sensitive results into unnecessary log stores.

## 4. Validate the natural-language query path in five steps

Run a small acceptance set in this order, using only enterprise-approved anonymized data:

1. **Confirm scope**: Establish the approved tables, fields, conditions, and roles for each scenario, then obtain sign-off from business, security, and IT owners.
2. **Verify separation**: Submit a normal query and confirm that the AI platform sends a controlled request while the gateway owns the database connection and credentials.
3. **Test boundary rejection**: Submit an unknown field, an out-of-range period, and a write operation. Confirm that the gateway rejects each request and records an audit event.
4. **Test permission isolation**: Use an account without access to restricted data. Confirm rejection, administrator notification, and logs that identify the user and rule.
5. **Review results**: Have a business owner check field meaning, calculation definitions, and intended use for normal and rejected samples before expanding scope.

The acceptance report should retain samples, configuration versions, request identifiers, expected results, actual results, and open risks. Measure result correctness, response time, and audit completeness separately; one passing metric does not qualify the full path for production.

## 5. Recognize common failure modes

### Letting the AI platform hold database credentials

Long-lived credentials in platform configuration increase the impact of a compromise. Centralize credentials in the gateway, use short-lived least-privilege authorization, and retest every connection after rotation.

### Relying on prompts as the only query control

The model may generate fields or conditions outside the business scope. Enforce scope in gateway rules, test rejection behavior, and review rule hits continuously.

### Treating generated explanations as deterministic facts

Natural-language explanations can omit conditions or misread fields. Add human review for finance, permission, and operational decisions, and retain the original query, structured result, and review conclusion.

## 6. Pre-production checklist

- Every scope item maps to a gateway rule;
- database credentials are absent from AI platform configuration, logs, and prompts;
- normal, out-of-scope, unauthorized, and network-failure samples are tested;
- read-only and write paths use separate permissions and approvals;
- audit events include request, user, rule, and result status;
- business, security, and IT owners confirm open risks and rollback actions.
