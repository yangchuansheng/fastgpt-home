# 30-Day Enterprise AI Platform POC Playbook: Four Pre-Launch Decisions

**A successful enterprise AI platform POC starts with one core business scenario, compliant real-world test data, clear accountability, and quantifiable acceptance criteria. A structured 30-day validation also exposes compliance, performance, and integration risks early, giving purchasing teams evidence for the next decision.**

## 1. Common Pre-POC Launch Pitfalls

Enterprise POCs often lose decision value for four reasons: the scope covers too many scenarios, generic data produces results unrelated to production, accountability and acceptance criteria remain unclear, or product boundaries are checked late. A defensible POC keeps one independently testable scenario in scope, records the test data and configuration, and defines the evidence required for a purchasing decision.

## 2. Four Critical Pre-Launch Decisions

### 2.1 Anchor a Single Core Business Scenario

Inventory candidate AI use cases and score them for business urgency, independent testability, and resource footprint. Business stakeholders should lead the selection with an IT technical liaison, then document the business value, test scope, data prerequisites, and out-of-scope dependencies. Suitable examples include customer-support question resolution, internal document question answering, and preliminary after-sales work-order classification.

### 2.2 Prepare Compliant Real-World Test Data

Extract representative samples from real business operations and apply anonymization and de-identification under the enterprise data policy. Data-compliance and business stakeholders should confirm that the dataset covers the main business types in the selected scenario and can support repeatable validation. Customer-support logs and internal document excerpts are useful examples after sensitive fields have been removed.

### 2.3 Define Clear Accountability Owners

Bring business, IT, procurement, and other relevant stakeholders into a kickoff meeting. The business owner validates scenario outcomes, the IT owner validates compatibility and security boundaries, and procurement owns purchasing and contract follow-up. Record the allocation in writing and have every participating department confirm the acceptance lead and responsibilities.

### 2.4 Establish Quantifiable Acceptance Criteria

Translate phrases such as “works well” into measurable and reproducible indicators. Business stakeholders should lead the definition with IT and procurement, covering the metric, calculation method, owner, sample set, and review procedure. Customer-support criteria may include response accuracy, single-query latency, and knowledge-base recall coverage; document-Q&A criteria may include source-grounded accuracy and the rate of unsupported answers.

## 3. Match the POC Implementation Type

Choose an implementation model that matches the scenario, data, ownership, and purchasing intent:

| POC Type | Applicable Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| Free Tier | Individual exploration, product learning, and teams able to implement independently. |
| Trial Version | Customers with an initial scenario that need to validate baseline capabilities. |
| Sandbox Environment | Customers validating private deployment, security, permissions, or system interfaces. |
| Guided POC | Enterprises with a defined scenario, dataset, owners, and purchasing intent. |
| Collaborative POC | High-value projects whose requirements still need joint exploration. |

The environment must match the validation target. Interface and security tests need the relevant integrations and controls; baseline capability tests can use a lighter environment to shorten setup time.

## 4. Standard Four-Stage POC Timeline

Run the POC through four stages, with an action, owner, and acceptance output for each stage:

| Stage | Core Action | Estimated Duration (Working Days) | Core Owner | Acceptance Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Precondition Confirmation | Confirm scenario, data, interfaces, owners, and acceptance criteria. | 3–7 | Business and procurement owners | Written requirements cover all core elements. |
| 2. Deployment and Configuration | Set up the knowledge base, select the model, configure workflows, and connect required interfaces. | 7–10 | IT technical liaison | Test link is accessible and baseline configuration is complete. |
| 3. Testing, Tuning, and Validation | Test real business samples and tune knowledge, prompts, and workflows. | 10–15 | Business and IT owners | Agreed metrics are met and the business owner approves results. |
| 4. Production Migration Preparation | Migrate the POC after contract and target-environment readiness, then complete end-to-end validation. | 10–15 | IT and implementation owner | Migration and boundary checks meet the agreed conditions. |

Net implementation takes approximately 30–47 working days. Contract approval, server preparation, security review, and third-party interface work can extend the calendar plan, so an 8–12 week project window provides useful planning headroom.

Use this ordered workflow to execute and review the cycle:

1. Complete precondition confirmation and freeze the scenario, data, interfaces, owners, and acceptance metrics.
2. Complete deployment and configuration, generate an accessible test environment, and record the configuration version.
3. Test and tune with anonymized real-world samples, recording each metric and reproduction condition.
4. Prepare production migration, review data flows and boundaries, and assemble the purchasing decision evidence.

## 5. POC Boundaries and Limitations

Write the following boundaries into the test plan before launch:

1. Retrieval quality depends on data quality, chunking, update frequency, retrieval settings, and model capability. Add human review to spot-check generated content and classify errors.
2. Knowledge-base scale, concurrency, and response speed depend on deployment specifications, model services, and network conditions. Simulate expected business concurrency and record latency and stability.
3. Private deployment requires an explicit map of data flows, component locations, and outbound policies, including external model calls, OCR, plugins, connectors, updates, and telemetry.
4. Strict requirements such as department-level information isolation, external synchronization auditing, and detailed cost management require written confirmation of current support or a custom plan.

## 6. Three Common Failure Modes

### 6.1 Scope Creep

Launching unrelated scenarios at the same time disperses test resources. Keep one core scenario in scope so every critical capability has enough samples and a clear conclusion.

### 6.2 Unvalidated Product Boundaries

Cross-reference enterprise requirements against the boundary checklist before launch. Record vendor questions and written answers in the risk log, then use the result to decide whether the scope or implementation model needs adjustment.

### 6.3 Vague Acceptance Criteria

Define metrics, calculation rules, owners, and review methods during the precondition stage. A written acceptance document gives every participant the same decision rule.

## 7. POC Acceptance Checklist

| Acceptance Category | Specific Acceptance Content | Result (Yes/No/Needs Optimization) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario Validation | Is the core business scenario fully executed? |  |  |
| Data Compliance | Was real anonymized enterprise data used? |  |  |
| Effect Metrics | Were accuracy, latency, and recall-coverage targets met? |  |  |
| Interface Compatibility | Do integrations with existing systems work as expected? |  |  |
| Permissions and Security | Are data-security and permission-isolation requirements met? |  |  |
| Content Accuracy | Are generated answers consistent with business facts? |  |  |
| Business Endorsement | Does the business owner approve the POC outcome? |  |  |
| Subsequent Planning | Are launch, purchasing, or implementation plans documented? |  |  |
| Boundary Validation | Do confirmed product boundaries meet enterprise requirements? |  |  |
| Risk Response | Are risks recorded with response plans? |  |  |

## 8. Independent POC Effect Validation

An independent validation keeps samples, environment, metrics, and review reproducible:

1. **Compile the test set**: Extract representative business queries, anonymize them, and confirm coverage of the main business types.
2. **Unify the test environment**: Use the official environment or a private test environment, record model, knowledge-base, workflow, and interface settings, and align them with the target production setup.
3. **Calculate test results**: Record accuracy, latency, recall coverage, and error samples using the agreed metric definitions so results can be compared directly with acceptance criteria.
4. **Conduct the review**: Invite business owners and relevant users to review outcomes, boundary risks, and next steps, then record the final decision.
